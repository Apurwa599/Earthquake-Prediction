## Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learing
This is an academic project completed during my 4th semester as part of the Data Analytics curriculum.

## Project Overview:
This academic project focuses on predicting earthquake occurrences using historical seismic data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patterns in earthquake data and build a predictive model that can estimate earthquake magnitude based on input features.

### Objectives:
-Analyze historical earthquake data
-Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
-Train machine learning models for prediction
-Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics
