## Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learing
This is an academic project completed during my 4th semester as part of the Data Analytics curriculum.

## Project Overview:
This academic project focuses on predicting earthquake occurrences using historical seismic data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patterns in earthquake data and build a predictive model that can estimate earthquake magnitude based on input features.

## Objectives:
-Analyze historical earthquake data

-Perform data preprocessing and feature selection

-Train machine learning models for prediction

-Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

## Technologies Used:
 Python,NumPy,Pandas Matplotlib & Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Description:
 The dataset contains historical earthquake records including features such as magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, and time-related attributes. The data is preprocessed    to handle missing values and improve model performance.
